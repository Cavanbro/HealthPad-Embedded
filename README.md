## 🚀 Overview

Provide a high-level overview of your consumer hardware and what this repository includes.

> Example:
> This repository contains firmware and related code for the HealthPad, a consumer device that reminds users when to take their medication via LED indicators and tracks pill usage with magnetic sensors.

---

## ✨ Features

* LED ring for real-time pill reminders
* Magnetic sensor for pill bottle detection
* Mobile integration via Bluetooth/WiFi
* Local data logging and sync
* OTA (Over-the-Air) firmware updates (if applicable)

---

## 🔧 Hardware Requirements

List the specific hardware components required to run your code.

> Example:

* ESP32 Development Board
* Neopixel LED Ring (24 LEDs)
* A3144 Hall Effect Switch
* Micro-USB Cable
* 5V Power Supply
* 3D Printed Enclosure 

---

## 💻 Software Setup

Mention software tools, SDKs, and libraries needed.

> Example:

* PlatformIO / Arduino IDE
* ESP32 board support package
* Adafruit NeoPixel Library
* \[Insert any Bluetooth/WiFi/MQTT library]

---

## ▶️ Usage

Explain how to operate the device once flashed and powered on.

> Example:

1. Plug in the device.
2. Upload script while holding down "download" button on ESP32
4. Place pill bottles with attached magnets on the pad.
5. When it's time to take your pill, the LED will turn red.
6. Once the bottle is removed and returned, the status will update to blue (pill taken).

## 🔨 Development

Provide any notes for developers who want to modify the code:

* File structure
* How configurations are handled (e.g., `config.h`)
* Testing framework (if any)
* Serial debug commands

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

| Issue                       | Solution                                              |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| LEDs not lighting up        | Check power supply and LED data pin connection        |
| Sensor not detecting bottle | Ensure magnet polarity is correct and sensor is wired |
| WiFi not connecting         | Double-check `wifi_credentials.h` or serial monitor   |

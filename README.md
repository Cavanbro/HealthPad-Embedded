## ✨ Features

* LED ring for real-time pill reminders
* Magnetic sensor for pill bottle detection
* Mobile integration via Bluetooth/WiFi
* Local data logging and sync
* OTA (Over-the-Air) firmware updates (if applicable)

---

## 🔧 Hardware Requirements

List the specific hardware components required to run your code.

> Example:

* ESP32 Development Board
* Neopixel LED Ring (24 LEDs)
* Magnetic Reed Switch or Hall Effect Sensor
* Micro-USB Cable
* 5V Power Supply
* 3D Printed Enclosure (optional)

---

## 💻 Software Setup

Mention software tools, SDKs, and libraries needed.

> Example:

* PlatformIO / Arduino IDE
* ESP32 board support package
* Adafruit NeoPixel Library
* \[Insert any Bluetooth/WiFi/MQTT library]

## 📥 Installation

Step-by-step instructions to flash or install code on the hardware.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git

# Open in PlatformIO or Arduino IDE
# Install dependencies as listed above

# Compile and upload
```

## ▶️ Usage

Explain how to operate the device once flashed and powered on.

> Example:

1. Plug in the device.
2. Place pill bottles with attached magnets on the pad.
3. When it's time to take your pill, the LED will turn red.
4. Once the bottle is removed and returned, the status will update to yellow (pill taken).

| Issue                       | Solution                                              |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| LEDs not lighting up        | Check power supply and LED data pin connection        |
| Sensor not detecting bottle | Ensure magnet polarity is correct and sensor is wired |
| WiFi not connecting         | Double-check `wifi_credentials.h` or serial monitor   |
